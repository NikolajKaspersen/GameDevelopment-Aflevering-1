# GameDevelopment-Aflevering-1

###
GameDev Group:
Christoffer, Nikolaj, and Oliver

In this assignment, we have created our own elements:
Modeling of a low-poly character
Developed scripts in C# for the following purposes:

MoveController
JumpController
Death & respawn controllers
Additionally, we have focused on presenting a small graphical scene on a terrain with water. We have utilized Unity's built-in effects, including Rigidbody, gravity, vituelCamera and collision. At the same time, we have also used free assets that we found on the Asset Store.

####
Game premise:
Safely cross to the other side of the water using the barrels, but beware of the current taking you away!

Controls:
Movement: W, A, S, D, or arrow keys
Jump: Spacebar
